# Pokeapi Wrapper Python

## Description
A simple Python application using Flask that simplies the Pokeapi result set when you search for a Pok√©mon.

## Requirements
For development, you will only need [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/), installed in your environement. 

### Cordova

- #### Node installation on your platform

  Just go on [official Cordova setup](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/index.html).

### Node and NPM

You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command from your command line:

    $ node --version        

    $ npm --version
    
## Installation

### Project
    $ git clone https://github.com/brworkit/cordova-socket-client.git
    $ cd cordova-socket-client
    $ npm install (to install the required modules)
    
## Usage

Start the socket server you can clone [from this link](https://github.com/brworkit/socket-node-example.git) following the README instructions and run it locally.

## Run Cordova App

Start Cordova App at browser using:
    
    $ cordova run

Start Cordova App at Android device/emulator using:
    
    $ cordova run android

    **PS:** maybe locally in android device you will not see the timer because it wont be able to find your localhost. Soon I will make a setup of a live url to suport it.
